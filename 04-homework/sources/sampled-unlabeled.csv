I WAS DRIVING MY CAR AND WAS IN A TURN WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL KICKED BACK THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I WAS TURNING AND I NEARLY WENT OFF THE ROAD. THE FORCE WAS SO GREAT THAT IT ACTUALLY INJURED MY SHOULDER WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL KICKED BACK. THE STEERING IN THE CAR HAS SINCE BEEN SO SLOPPY THAT I AM SCARED TO DRIVE IT, THE CAR IS ALL OVER THE ROAD. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE VEHICLE NEEDED TO BE ALIGNED. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL TIRE STORE AND THEY CHECKED THE ALIGNMENT WHICH WAS ALL IN FACTORY SPECS. TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER TEST DROVE WITH A TECHNICIAN WHO DROVE WITH ME AND HE STATED IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN ALIGNMENT PROBLEM. I LEFT THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALER FOR 3 DAYS AND GOT A CALL THAT IT WAS READY TO BE PICKED UP. WHEN ASKED WHAT WAS DONE I WAS TOLD NOTHING...THE CAR NEEDS TO BE ALIGNED. I HAD THEM ALIGN THE VEHICLE WHICH BY THE WAY DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. PLEASE HELP BEFORE THIS CAR KILLS ME OR SOMEONE ELSE.  *TR"
