THE VEHICLE HAS HAD ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS CAUSING ENGINE FAILURE WHILE DRIVING, NAVIGATION FAILURE WHILE DRIVING, MOTORIZED GAS AND BRAKE PEDAL MOVEMENT WHILE DRIVING, FUEL TANK ELECTRICAL ISSUES, ALL OF WHICH HAS CREATED UNSAFE SITUATIONS FOR MY WIFE AND CHILDREN RIDING IN THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE IS UNDEPENDABLE DUE TO NUMEROUS ELECTRICAL ISSUES. I HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH CADILLAC FOR A REPLACEMENT WITH NO SUCCESSES. IF WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AS DIRECTED BY CADILLAC, IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE AN INJURY OR DEATH OCCURS.

,"WHILE WAITING AT A RED LIGHT IN TRAFFIC ON A HIGHWAY, I PULLED IN THE CLUTCH, PUT THE BIKE INTO GEAR AND THE BIKE MADE A LOUD, METALLIC GRINDING SOUND.  THIS FAILURE ONLY HAPPENED ONCE IN THE TIME I HAVE OWNED THIS MOTORCYCLE (2 1/2 MONTHS); HOWEVER, IT WAS A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE DRIVETRAIN THAT LEFT MY BIKE UNABLE TO TRAVEL UNDER ITS OWN POWER AND STRANDED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF HEAVY, FAST MOVING TRAFFIC. (THIS HAPPENED ON THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY IN MANHATTAN.) FOR MY PERSONAL SAFETY AND TO PREVENT MY DISABLED MOTORCYCLE FROM CAUSING AN ACCIDENT,  I HAD TO PUSH THE BIKE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THROUGH GAPS IN TRAFFIC.  THE REPAIR REQUIRED A FULL CLUTCH REPLACEMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE INPUT SHAFT TO THE TRANSMISSION (WITHRELATED SEALS AND SHIMS.) *TR"

THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE TIRES OR WHEELS, BUT THE SIDE IMPACT CURTAIN AIRBAG ON OUR 1999 BMW 323I SUDDENLY DEPLOYED. WE RESEARCHED RECALLS ON OUR VEHICLE. WE FOUND THE FOLLOWING:    NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER:   02V223000  SUMMARY:    ON CERTAIN 4-DOOR PASSENGER VEHICLES, THE SIDE AIR BAG SYSTEM COULD DEPLOY IN CERTAIN NON-CRASH IMPACTS, SUCH AS WHEN CONTACTING LARGE POTHOLES OR CURBS AT SUBSTANTIAL SPEEDS.  CONSEQUENCE:    THIS COULD CAUSE THE SIDE AIR BAG AND HEAD PROTECTION SYSTEM TO DEPLOY WITHOUT AN ACTUAL SIDE CRASH OR IMPACT SEVERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE. UNEXPECTED DEPLOYMENT OF THE SIDE AIR BAG COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY IF THE OCCUPANT'S HEAD IS RESTING NEAR THE SIDE AIR BAG.

,"SECOND COMPLAINT REGARDING THE TURN SIGNAL ELECTRICAL PROBLEM.  THIS PROBLEM IS A RESULT OF A DEFECTIVE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH AND IS PRESENT IN OTHER YEARS OF THE GRAND AM AS WELL AS OTHER GM VEHICLES. IN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM I HAVE LEARNED THAT IT IS NOT A MATTER OF ""IF"" IT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR PONTIAC BUT RATHER ""WHEN"" IT WILL HAPPEN.  MY PONTIAC WAS REPAIRED JANURARY 18, 2008.  THE FOLLOWING IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE REPAIR FROM THE MECHANIC:  DIAGNOSE CLICKING NOISE IN DASH, DISMANTLE DASH FACE AND CHECK WIRING AND SWITCHES, CHECK TBS'S AND RECALLS.  PROBLEM CAUSED BY SHORT IN MULTI FUNCTION SWITCH THAT DAMAGED FLASHER UNIT.  R&R STEERING COLUMN COVERS AND AIR BAG TO GAIN ACCESS TO REPLACE MULTI FUNCTION SWITCH, REPLACE HAZARD LAMP SWITCH/FLASHER UNIT.  PART DESCRIPTION:  MULTI FUNCTION SWITCH ASSEMBLY (HEADLAMPS, WIPERS, TURN SIGNALS, DIMMER ALL IN ONE UNIT.)  HAZARD LAMP/FLASHER UNIT ASSEMBLY.  TOTAL COST $474.31.  MY COST TO RENT A CAR $59.85.   IF YOU WILL REFER BACK TO 2000, GM RECALL NO03043 AND 2001 GM RECALL NO03043 YOU WILL SEE THESE VEHICLES WERE RECALLED FOR EXACTLY THE SAME THING!  IN ADDITION TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF A POSSIBLE CRASH AS A RESULT OF THE DEFECTIVE SWITCH THAT YOU NOTED, YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD THAT 1) IT IS VERY DISTRACTING 2) IF THE VEHICLE IS NOT REPAIRED, THE BRAKE LITES START FAILING, THE STEERING ASSEMBLY STARTS SMOKING....AND BEST OF ALL, IF YOU TAKE IT TO CERTIAN PONTIAC DEALERS THEY HAVE ACTUALLY STATED THAT THE SMOKING WAS NORMAL DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS!!!

AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, IT IS APPARENT THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE AMONG THIS DESIGN OF THE SILVERADO. FORUM AFTER FORUM HAS OWNERS DESCRIBING THIS SAME ISSUE AND MORE PROBLEMS WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN THAT COULD END UP KILLING SOMEONE. HEADLIGHTS AND RUNNING LIGHTS THAT TURN OFF WITHOUT CAUSE? WHAT IF THE AIRBAG SYSTEM IS AFFECTED AND IT CAUSES A PREMATURE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT WHILE SOMEONE IS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED? THIS IS NOT AND ISOLATED ISSUE AND THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP IN TO FORCE GENERAL MOTORS TO RECALL THIS VEHICLE ALONG WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLES WITH THE SAME ISSUE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT GENERAL MOTORS MAY BE AWARE OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE 2011 AND 2012 SILVERADOS HAVE HAD DESIGN CHANGES MADE TO THEIR ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS.(I READ THIS IN FORUMS AS WELL.)   *TR"
